# Wisconsin Election Shapefiles
The 2011 shapefile, with election results from 2012-2016, was processed by members of the Voting Rights Data Institute. The Voting Rights Data Institute (VRDI) was a 2018 summer intensive sponsored by the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group (MGGG) at Tufts and MIT, with major support from a Bose Research Grant at MIT and from the Jonathan M. Tisch College of Civic Life at Tufts. The 2020 shapefile, with election results from 2012-2018), was processed by members of the MGGG.

## Sources
The wards shapefiles with election data come from the Wisconsin State Legislature's Legislative Technology Services Bureau (LTSB) and are available for download on the [LTSB Open Data Page](https://data-ltsb.opendata.arcgis.com). 

## Processing
The state of Wisconsin reports their election data at the level of ward groups. The LTSB disaggregates the data from the reported unit to wards using methods based on 2010 population, described in detail [here](https://data-ltsb.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/2018-2012-election-data-with-2011-wards) and [here](https://data-ltsb.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/2012-2018-election-data-with-2020-wards). However, the 2011 shapefile was disaggregated from ward groups to wards using voting age population, and the 2020 shapefile was disaggregated from ward groups to wards using total population.

The 2011 raw shapefile downloaded from the LTSB data portal contains many topology errors that made it impossible to use it to run [MGGG's Markov chain](https://gerrychain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The script [check_shapefile_connectivity.py](https://github.com/gerrymandr/Preprocessing) was run to fix these topology errors. Extremely minor changes were made to the 2020 shapefile to run [MGGG's Markov chain](https://gerrychain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Demographic data were aggregated from the block level using MGGGâ€™s proration software. Congressional and state legislative district IDs were also assigned to precincts using this package.

NOTE: The shapefile has results for 2014 that use the LTSB code for US Senate (USS). This is a mistake that the LTSB has fixed in later versions of this shapefile. There was no US Senate election in Wisconsin in 2014. These are the results for the Wisconsin state senate. This is reflected in the descriptions of the variables.
